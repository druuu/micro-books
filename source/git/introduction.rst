Git Introduction
===================

Git is an open source `SCM` (Source code management system). It is distributed source code management system, that means there is no central authority on the repository like perforce or subversion and everyone has access to the code repository can get the complete code.

Git will store all versions of files as changes between one version to the other in incremental fashion. These versions are called as commits.

`Here is the basic flow of code management with Git :`

* We create an empty Git repository.
* Configure user info to be used for further code commits as git will save each commit with user info.
* Add files to stage to be saved into git repository.
* Commit those changes.

A default master branch will be created on initial git commit and all the commits will be save in the branch. We can create new branches from previous commits of current selected branch to make any changes to files and keep those separate from base branch.
